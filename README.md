# Semester-Project_2

## Description

My semester project assignment was to create a wiki-style
website for front-end developers to store information about
coding, including syntax, and examples of how to create
elements for a site.

I have used Strapi as a headless CMS for managing the content.

- Wiki-style website for front-end developers
- Strapi
- Designed using Adobe XD

## Built With

- [Javascript](https://reactjs.org/)
- [HTML](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [SASS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## Getting Started

The project needs to be hosted to a database in order to fully work. It is currently not hosted to any DB, and as such there is no working API.

If you want to run the project, you can contact me via email and I will provide you with the local strapi database for you to use.

### Installing

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KIVERSEN86/Semester-Project_2.git
```

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, you need to make sure to open a pull request so the code can be reviewed before it is merged with the main branch
